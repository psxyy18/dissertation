This is the code for my dissertation project 'Machine Learning for Comparing Astronaut Biological Data to Disease Cohorts on Earth'
due to size limitation i'm unable to upload the csv files of the gene data, the jaxa dataset i used from here: 'https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-530'  and the geo dataset: 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE174302'
The code include the preprocessing of both datasets and visualization in .py files
and the script.ipynb (a jupyter notebook file) includes most of the procedures during the research which includes model rebuilding, parameters import and experiments conducted to provide overfitting and other stuff.
Supervised by Dr. Colin Johnson and Henry Cope.
